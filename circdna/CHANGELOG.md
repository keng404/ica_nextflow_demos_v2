## v1.0.0 - [2022-06-01]

Initial release of nf-core/circdna, created with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) template.

nf-core/circdna is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for the identification of circular DNAs in eukaryotic cells. The pipeline is able to process WGS, ATAC-seq data or Circle-Seq data to give insights into the circular DNA landscape in your samples.

In total, the user can choose between 5 different branches inside the pipeline, depending on the biological question and the input data set. In these branches, specific software is used that is built for either the identification of amplified circular DNAs, the detection of putative circular DNA junctions, or the de novo assembly and mapping of circular DNAs.

# nf-core/demultiplex: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [bcl-convert](#bcl-convert) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [bases2fastq](#bases2fastq) - converting bases files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [bcl2fastq](#bcl2fastq) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [fastp](#fastp) - Adapter and quality trimming
- [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
- [md5sum](#md5sum) - Creates an MD5 (128-bit) checksum of every fastq.
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - aggregate report, describing results of the whole pipeline

### bcl-convert

[bcl-convert](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl-convert.html) Conversion Software both demultiplexes data and converts BCL files generated by Illumina sequencing systems to standard FASTQ file formats for downstream analysis.

- `samplename/sample.fastq.gz`
  - Untrimmed raw fastq files

</details>

### bases2fastq

[bases2fastq](https://go.elementbiosciences.com/bases2fastq-download) demultiplexes sequencing data and converts base calls generated by the Element AVITIâ„¢ System into FASTQ files for secondary analysis with FASTQ-compatible software.

### fastp

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*.fastp.html`: Trimming report in html format.
  - `*.fastp.json`: Trimming report in json format.
  - `*.fastp.log`: Trimming log file.

</details>

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a tool designed to provide fast, all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files. It has been developed in C++ with multithreading support to achieve higher performance. fastp is used in this pipeline for standard adapter trimming and quality filtering.

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

> **NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, input reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality. To see how your reads look after adapter and quality trimming please refer to the FastQC reports in the `trimgalore/fastqc/` directory.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### md5sum

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*.fastq.gz.md5`: MD5 checksum of fastq

</details>

Creates an MD5 (128-bit) checksum of every fastq.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
